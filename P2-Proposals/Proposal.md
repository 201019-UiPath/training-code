# Game-Getter

#### Overview
We are automating the way we find new videogames. This project will be able to sign into both Steam on Epic Games stores and identify which games are free or on sale. Then, it will able to gather the potential games from both stores to a single location, where the user will then be able to select which games to purchase or download for free. Lastly, the robot will fill in the user's payment information, complete the purchase, and start the download. 

#### What we are automating
- Opening multiple applications (Steam & Epic Games Launcher)
- Sign in using user's credentials
- Find free games and scape data about the game
- Create excel sheet of potential games from both stores
- Fill in payment informaiton and complete purchase
