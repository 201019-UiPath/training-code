### Team 1 - Empty String 
#### P2 Proposal - Shantel Chi, Shalei Kumar, Andres Siles-Loayza

##### Overview
We want to create a robot that tracks how long we are on specific websites while we are on the browser. 

User can input websites they want to put a time limit on and our robot will alert the user when they exceed that limit.

If time permits we would also like to track how much time is spent on other applications. 

##### Applications
* UiPath Studio
* Chrome\FireFox\IE
* Excel
